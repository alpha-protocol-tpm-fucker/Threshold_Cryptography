# Threshold_Cryptography

I read FIDO was TPM locked yesterday but ChatGPT hallucinated and I was happy to buy it for some reason omg.. 

Let me think how to do this instead

This design is standard in threshold-RSA, threshold-ECDSA (FROST), and DKG + threshold-BLS systems; the additional public-key sharing ring is simply another SSS layer over a non-sensitive value, so itâ€™s perfectly sound cryptography-wise.


# There's no way to make a better TPM here.
